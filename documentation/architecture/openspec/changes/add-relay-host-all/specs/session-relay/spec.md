## ADDED Requirements
### Requirement: Bundle Group Membership Field

Per-bundle TOML configuration SHALL support optional top-level bundle group
membership field:

- `groups` (`string[]`)

This field applies to bundle-level relay host grouping and SHALL NOT change
session routing identity semantics.

Group naming rules:

- reserved/system group names are uppercase
- custom group names are lowercase
- `ALL` is reserved and implicit

#### Scenario: Accept bundle file with custom groups

- **WHEN** bundle file includes `groups = ["dev", "login"]`
- **THEN** the system loads the bundle configuration successfully

#### Scenario: Accept bundle file without groups

- **WHEN** bundle file omits `groups`
- **THEN** the system loads the bundle configuration successfully

#### Scenario: Reject explicit ALL group in bundle groups

- **WHEN** bundle file includes `ALL` in `groups`
- **THEN** the system rejects configuration with
  `validation_reserved_group_name`

#### Scenario: Reject invalid uppercase custom group

- **WHEN** bundle file includes uppercase custom group name not reserved by
  system
- **THEN** the system rejects configuration with
  `validation_invalid_group_name`
