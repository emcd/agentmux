## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Look Response Contract

Successful relay look responses SHALL include:

- `schema_version`
- `requester_session`
- `target_session`
- `captured_at`
- `snapshot_format` (`lines` | `structured_entries_v1`)

`bundle_name` is retired from look responses; bundle context is recoverable
from the `target_session` suffix.

When `snapshot_format = "lines"`, responses SHALL include:
- `snapshot_lines` (`string[]`)

When `snapshot_format = "structured_entries_v1"`, responses SHALL include:
- `snapshot_entries` (`object[]`) using the canonical structured entry
  vocabulary (transport-neutral; produced by ACP today).

For ACP targets, successful relay look responses SHALL additionally include:

- `freshness` (`fresh` | `stale`) (required)
- `snapshot_source` (`live_buffer` | `none`) (required)
- `entries_total` (`number`, required) — count of all entries available in
  the buffer before windowing; reflects the full buffer on every response,
  including stale and empty snapshots
- `returned_entries_count` (`number`, required) — count of entries in
  `snapshot_entries` after windowing; SHALL equal the length of
  `snapshot_entries`
- `stale_reason_code` (required when `freshness=stale`; absent otherwise)
- `snapshot_age_ms` (optional; omitted when unavailable)

ACP stale reason vocabulary:

- `acp_worker_initializing`
- `acp_worker_unavailable`
- `acp_snapshot_prime_timeout`
- `acp_stream_stalled`

#### Scenario: Return canonical look payload for tmux target

- **WHEN** look succeeds for tmux target
- **THEN** relay returns `snapshot_format="lines"`
- **AND** includes ordered `snapshot_lines` from oldest to newest
- **AND** ACP additive fields are omitted

#### Scenario: Return structured-entries look payload for ACP target

- **WHEN** look succeeds for ACP target
- **THEN** relay returns `snapshot_format="structured_entries_v1"`
- **AND** includes `snapshot_entries`
- **AND** includes required ACP additive fields `freshness`,
  `snapshot_source`, `entries_total`, and `returned_entries_count`

#### Scenario: Report entry counts for windowed ACP look

- **WHEN** ACP look returns a window narrower than the full buffer
- **THEN** `entries_total` reflects the full buffer count
- **AND** `returned_entries_count` equals the length of `snapshot_entries`
- **AND** `returned_entries_count <= entries_total`

#### Scenario: Keep required ACP fields when snapshot is empty

- **WHEN** ACP look succeeds with `snapshot_entries=[]`
- **THEN** relay still includes required `freshness`, `snapshot_source`,
  `entries_total`, and `returned_entries_count`
- **AND** `returned_entries_count=0`
