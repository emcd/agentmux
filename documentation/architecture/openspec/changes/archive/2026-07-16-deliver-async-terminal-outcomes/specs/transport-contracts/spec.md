## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Tmux Prime Timeout

The system SHALL surface a config-surfaced prime timeout knob for
Tmux-backed sessions, applied as the `prime-timeout-ms` TOML key under
the per-coder `[coders.<id>.tmux]` table (no `tmux-` prefix; the table
itself namespaces the key). The knob SHALL bound the time the Tmux
transport waits, during the quiescence wait for a flush group, for the
target to produce observable output before classifying the flush
group as `unresponsive`. The knob is **opt-in**: when absent or
`None`, the Tmux transport preserves today's unbounded behavior.

The prime timeout SHALL be communicated from the relay to the Tmux
transport through a generic `DeliveryEnvelope.prime_timeout_ms:
Option<u64>` field. The relay populates this field from
`[coders.<id>.tmux].prime-timeout-ms` at envelope construction time.
The field is generic across transports: the relay does not know which
transport will consume it; the ACP delivery-side timeout follow-up
will populate the same field for ACP sessions from a corresponding
`[coders.<id>.acp].prime-timeout-ms` key.

The prime timer SHALL start at the moment the Tmux transport's
internal delivery task begins the quiescence wait for a flush group.
The prime timer SHALL NOT reset on coalesce-during-wait when new
envelopes are absorbed into the flush group during the prime window.

No transport-observable operator rendering state (tmux copy-mode or a
non-`root` client key-table) SHALL suppress the prime timer. A quiescence
wait SHALL always progress toward one of its terminal classifications; the
prime timer SHALL NOT be held off indefinitely on the basis of a rendering
signal the relay cannot bound.

When the prime timer fires (no observable output within the prime
window), the Tmux transport SHALL resolve every sender in the flush group
with `SendOutcome::Timeout`. The `Timeout` outcome SHALL remain a distinct
terminal outcome and SHALL NOT be collapsed into `Failed`. As a non-delivered
outcome it SHALL be surfaced to the sender through the Asynchronous
Terminal-Outcome Receipt and recorded per Async Delivery Observability; it SHALL
NOT be returned in the synchronous accept-time response.

#### Scenario: Prime timeout fires on unresponsive target

- **WHEN** the bundle config sets `[coders.<id>.tmux].prime-timeout-ms`
  to a finite millisecond value
- **AND** the Tmux transport's internal delivery task begins the
  quiescence wait for a flush group
- **AND** the target pane produces no observable output before the
  prime window elapses
- **THEN** every sender in the flush group receives
  `SendOutcome::Timeout`
- **AND** no message is injected into the pane

#### Scenario: Prime timeout defaults preserve unbounded behavior

- **WHEN** the bundle config does not set
  `[coders.<id>.tmux].prime-timeout-ms` (or sets it to `None`)
- **THEN** the Tmux transport does not classify any flush group as
  `unresponsive`
- **AND** the only terminal failure modes for a flush group are
  `Failed` + `reason_code = "pane_wedged"` (when wedge detection is
  enabled, which is the default) and `Shutdown`

#### Scenario: Prime timer does not reset on coalesce-during-wait

- **WHEN** the Tmux transport's internal delivery task is
  mid-prime-window for a flush group
- **AND** a new envelope arrives and is absorbed into the flush group
  via coalesce-during-wait
- **THEN** the prime timer continues to count down against the
  original prime window anchor (set at first wait start)
- **AND** the absorbed envelope does NOT extend or restart the prime
  window
