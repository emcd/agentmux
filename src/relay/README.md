# Relay Module

This directory contains relay internals and the public request/response types
exported from `src/relay/mod.rs`.

## Primary Responsibilities

- Serve relay socket requests and stream-framed requests.
- Enforce authorization policy for list/send/look operations.
- Execute lifecycle transitions (`up`, `down`) per bundle.
- Route delivery across tmux and ACP transports.
- Maintain stream endpoint registration keyed by `(bundle_name, session_id)`.

## File Map

- `mod.rs`
  - public re-export hub plus relay entrypoint wrappers.
- `contract.rs`
  - relay request/response enums and public payload structs.
- `context.rs`
  - internal request context and delivery task structs shared across relay
    submodules.
- `constants.rs`
  - relay-local constants shared across submodules.
- `identity.rs`
  - canonical/bare session identity helpers.
- `errors.rs`
  - relay error constructors and configuration error mapping.
- `client.rs`
  - relay socket client helpers and persistent stream session request/event
    polling.
- `connection.rs`
  - relay socket serving, stream hello/request frame dispatch, hello identity
    validation, and connection write-timeout handling.
- `authorization.rs`
  - policy loading and operation-level authorization checks.
- `handlers.rs`
  - request dispatcher plus chat/look/raww handlers.
- `handlers/listing.rs`
  - lifecycle and list-session request handlers.
- `handlers/permissions.rs`
  - permission snapshot, list, and decision request handlers.
- `lifecycle.rs`
  - runtime reconcile/shutdown helpers for managed sessions.
- `stream.rs`
  - hello-frame parser, stream registry, identity collision handling, and event
    writer routing.
- `tmux.rs`
  - tmux/process adapters used by delivery and look paths.
- `delivery/`
  - transport-specific delivery decomposition:
  - `dispatch/mod.rs`: delivery dispatch re-export hub.
  - `dispatch/orchestration.rs`: delivery startup, enqueue, and per-target
    orchestration.
  - `dispatch/payload.rs`: envelope/raw payload preparation and UI routing.
  - `dispatch/transport.rs`: ACP/tmux transport-specific dispatch.
  - `dispatch/worker.rs`: async worker loop and ACP respawn handling.
  - `async_worker.rs`: async queue worker behavior.
  - `acp_client.rs`, `acp_delivery.rs`, `acp_state.rs`: ACP lifecycle,
    prompt flow, and snapshot persistence helpers.
  - `ui_delivery.rs`: UI-stream event emission for delivery completion.
  - `results.rs`, `quiescence.rs`: shared outcome and quiescence logic.

## Runtime Behavior Notes

- Chat delivery is async-only; `delivery_mode` is no longer part of the relay
  send API. With the field removed, an internally tagged request silently
  ignores it like any other unrecognised field.
- ACP delivery supports `acp_turn_timeout_ms`; tmux delivery uses
  `quiescence_timeout_ms`.
- Pre-hello idle sockets are reaped in host connection workers to prevent
  starvation (`AGENTMUX_RELAY_PRE_HELLO_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` override).
- Each connection owns a per-connection writer task (mpsc + tokio write half)
  that applies a relay-to-client write timeout
  (`AGENTMUX_RELAY_CONNECTION_WRITE_TIMEOUT_MS` override, default 5s). A
  stalled client cannot pin the writer — or, via cloned writer senders, a
  delivery worker — indefinitely: a tripped write emits a
  `relay.connection.write_timeout` inscription and the writer task exits,
  closing the channel so cloned senders surface the disconnect.
- The stream registry entry is released via a drop guard so an async-cancelled
  connection cannot leak a registry entry and wedge the next same-identity
  reconnect into an identity-claim conflict.
- Host accept loops emit `relay.connection_pool.metrics` on each accept
  (`max_connections`/`active`/`rejected` counts) so saturation against the
  unified `AGENTMUX_RELAY_MAX_CONNECTIONS` cap is observable. Connections that
  exceed the cap receive a `runtime_connection_limit_reached` error.
- Stream events are correlated by `message_id` for send completion workflows.
